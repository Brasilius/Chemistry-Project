# Chemistry Project
This is a light weight program designed to help students in chemistry students by facilitating some easy calculation

On a more serious note, this is a heavy work-in-progress chemistry program. All I currently have planned is to:
- read off g/Mol ratios(COMPLETE!)
- perform mol -> g calculations(COMPLETE !)
- perform g -> mol calculations(soon)
- Balance Chemical equations(later lol)
- create lewis and molecular perspective diagrams(WAY later)
- UI update (soon maybe?)
